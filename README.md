- 👋 Hi, I’m @SantiagoDiegos
- 👀 I am interested in many things such as math, data analysis, programming languages, and teaching.
- 🌱 I am currently taking a course on web development and gaining some experience in the professional field. I am also planning to start my career in data science in the following months. Because those things require so much knowledge, I am trying to learn step by step. 
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on statistics, data, and teaching projects. I am passionate about applying statistical knowledge to real-world problems and communicating math topics efficiently to people without a mathematical background. 
- 📫 Reach me at santiago.diegos2020@gmail.com.
